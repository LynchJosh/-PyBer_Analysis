# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find the average fare price for a ride-sharing app based on three different environments(Urban)(Suburban)(Rural). A few months worth of data was collected for this analysis. After all the data was gathared a line chart was generated to visualize the key numbers from the 3 CSV files provided. 

## Results
 Of the 3 city types, Urban was the highest in fare value while Suburban and Rural were significantly lower in fare value.
- Urban fare value started around $1600 with a high of $2400
- Suburban fare value was rather consistent staying between $600 and $1400 
- Much like Suburban, Rural was consistently staying between $50 and $500


## Summary
- Hiring more drivers for the Rural and Suburban city types could benefit the company more as there is not a lot of competition in these city types.

- Prices could be raised in Suburban and Rural to expand the company in these uncompetitive markets

- More Drives could be hired in the urban city type to meet the demand
